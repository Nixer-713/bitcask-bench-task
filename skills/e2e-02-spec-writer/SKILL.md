# Spec Writer

## State Machine Interface

**Entry:** Read `wip/{task}/PIPELINE_STATE.md`. Verify `state` is `S2_SPEC_DRAFT` or `S2_SPEC_CHECK`. If `spec_iter > 3`, stop and escalate to orchestrator — do not proceed.

**Exit (all 5 checks pass):** Set `state → S2_SPEC_DONE`, then `→ S3A_IMPORT_AUDIT`, append History row.

**Exit (loop — any check fails):** Set `state → S2_SPEC_DRAFT`, increment `spec_iter`, reset `todo` to S2_SPEC_DRAFT catalogue todo, append History row.

## Core Standard

Two questions decide every inclusion decision. Both must be answered:

**Q1 — Does this belong to the public behavioral contract?**
> What the library promises to callers via its intended external interface.
> - Yes → proceed to Q2
> - No → omit

**Q2 — Is this non-derivable?**
> Can a senior engineer infer this from domain knowledge, design judgment, or common practice — without reading the library's source or docs?
> - Yes, derivable → omit (the model can figure it out)
> - No, library-specific → include explicitly

Only items that pass both questions belong in the spec. The goal is not exhaustive coverage of all public API details — it is making every non-derivable contract detail explicit so the model is never blocked by a knowledge gap it could not reasonably close on its own.

**Granularity principle:** Spec describes the contract, not the implementation. But all non-derivable contract details must be explicit. A spec that is too sparse causes collection failures; a spec that is too dense becomes a fill-in-the-blanks template rather than a reconstruction target.

**Public API** means: names in `__all__` or `__init__` exports, classes/functions with user-facing docstrings, types used in public examples or workflows. A name without an underscore prefix is not automatically public; the test is whether it is part of the intended external interface.

**Behavioral language** means: what the API promises (inputs, outputs, side effects, error conditions, state invariants) — not how it is implemented internally.

## Dual Audience Principle

**Write as the library author.** Every section of the spec body should read as if you are a developer explaining your own library to someone using it for the first time. A reader must not be able to tell this is a benchmark artifact. If any sentence sounds like it was written for an evaluator rather than a developer, rewrite it.

The spec serves two simultaneous purposes:

**1. Natural API documentation** — The candidate reads the spec as its sole information source. No benchmark metadata, no task IDs, no audit trail in the body. The spec title is just the library name; the content covers what the library does and how to use it.

**2. Evaluation protocol transparency** — The candidate must never fail due to confusion about how evaluation works, only due to a genuine capability gap. The `Evaluation Notes` section explicitly describes test dimensions and scoring approach — without revealing fixture shapes or expected values — so the candidate understands what will be tested and can prepare accordingly.

These two purposes are structurally separate: the spec body is natural library documentation; protocol information is confined to `Evaluation Notes`; audit metadata (task ID, version, delta, source boundary) lives in a stripped internal header never sent to the candidate.

## Source Documentation

Read source code and public documentation together to map the public API surface:

1. Source code: `__init__.py`, `__all__`, public class/function signatures, docstrings
2. PyPI page or GitHub README — product overview and install
3. Official docs site — getting started, API reference, CLI reference, examples/cookbook
4. `--help` output for each CLI subcommand

Record the exact sources consulted in the internal header (`source_boundary`) — not in the candidate-visible body.

**Reading workflow — do not begin writing the spec until these steps are complete:**

1. Read `__init__.py` and `__all__`. Produce a **public API surface list**: every exported name, with file path. This list is your working set. If this list is empty, you have not done the reading — stop.
2. Read docs body (not just headings): scan for `from pkg.module import Name` patterns, NamedTuple class names in return value examples, exception classes users catch or compare.
3. For each item on the surface list, answer Q1 then Q2 **individually**, one item at a time, before moving to the next. Do not batch-decide multiple items.
4. Write spec sections only after the full surface list has been processed.

The candidate agent must not see source code, tests, or score reports. The spec writer must read them.

## Must Include

Items in these categories belong in the spec **only when they pass Q2** — i.e., a senior engineer could not reasonably infer them without reading the library's docs or source. Standard patterns a competent engineer would produce anyway do not need to be stated.

- All public import paths and names: functions, classes, exceptions, namedtuples — including re-exports that appear in the public API surface even when they look like module-level aliases
- Scan docs body (not just headings): `from pkg.module import Name` patterns in code examples, NamedTuple class names in return value reprs, exception classes users are expected to catch or compare
- Function signatures: parameter names, types, defaults — where defaults or parameter names are library-specific and non-obvious
- Documented namespaces, engines, and data models a first-day engineer must know (e.g. Jinja2 syntax and `{{ cookiecutter.name }}` namespace)
- Special user-visible context keys (e.g. `_copy_without_render`, `_extensions`, `__prompts__`) when they appear in official docs
- Error semantics: which trigger condition -> which exception class — when the exception type is library-specific or non-obvious

**Behavioral constraints (engineer might implement inconsistently):**
- Product overview
- Context precedence rules (multi-source merge order)
- Cross-View Invariants: >=6 items, user-observable language, spanning all public projection pairs
- >=1 complete end-to-end workflow example
- Evaluation Notes: what test dimensions exist, no fixture shapes

## Must Not Include

- Internal module/file organization (engineer decides this)
- Algorithm step sequences ("Step 1: load JSON, Step 2: iterate keys")
- Framework choices ("use Click for CLI")
- Dependency version constraints
- Names of internal helpers absent from the public export surface — presence in test imports alone is not sufficient; check `__all__`, `__init__` exports, and user-facing examples/docstrings
- Private names (`_name`, `__name`) and names absent from the public export surface
- Internal implementation details of public classes (field names, internal maps, singleton structure) that are not part of the API contract

## Required Structure

Every spec file has two parts. Only the body is sent to the candidate.

**Internal header** (stripped before sending to candidate):

```
<!-- INTERNAL
task_id: {task-id}
spec_version: v{N}
delta: {what was added/removed from previous version and why}
source_boundary: {list of sources consulted: docs pages, source files}
-->
```

**Candidate-visible body** — reads like natural API documentation:

```
# {Library} Specification

## Product Overview
## Scope                        <- positive list: which feature areas ARE covered
## Installable Surface          <- import paths, CLI entry point
## Public API                   <- signatures, parameter semantics, data objects
## Behavioral Sections          <- per-domain state/operation contracts
## Error Semantics              <- exception class -> trigger condition
## Cross-View Invariants        <- >=6 items, user-observable language
## Representative Workflow(s)   <- >=1 end-to-end example
## Non-Goals                    <- explicit exclusions
## Evaluation Notes             <- test dimensions and evaluation protocol; no fixture shapes or expected values
```

The body must read as if written by a library author, not a benchmark designer. `Evaluation Notes` is the only section that describes the evaluation setup — it tells the candidate what dimensions are tested and how scoring works, so failures reflect capability gaps, not protocol confusion.

## Linkage with Test-Filter

Spec and test-filter are linked: spec describes what must be implemented; test-filter removes tests that check evaluation artifacts rather than model capability. Do not add defensive spec content to compensate for tests that should be filtered out — route those to test-filter instead.

## Validation

 (run after each draft, before candidate evaluation)

1. Is each feature traceable to public docs and "day-one required knowledge", not "experienced engineer's design choice"<-
2. Do any internal class names or undocumented module paths appear<-
3. Are invariants written in behavioral language, not code<-
4. Are Non-goals explicitly listed<-
5. Does any section implicitly assume a hidden fixture shape<-

All five must pass. Any failure -> patch and re-judge.

## Critical Experiment Results

| Change | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Missing one public import path (`utils.sqlite3`) | 100% collection failure - score completely invalid |
| Removing 2 invariants from a complete behavioral specification | Lost 14 system_e2e tests (25.38% -> 16.15%) |
| Adding algorithm steps / implementation blueprint | Model implements dependencies from scratch; 74 collection errors |

## Patching a Spec

When processing a `spec_patch_request.md` from task-judge, apply gaps using these three principles:

**1. Attach to the nearest host; do not create new structure.**
If the gap is a parameter, a CLI option, or a boundary condition of an existing concept, add it to the nearest existing code block signature or behavior bullet list. Do not create a new subsection. The reader should not be able to tell where the patch was inserted.

**2. Create a new section only for an independent concept domain.**
A concept warrants its own section when it has its own initialization/use/teardown lifecycle and cannot be naturally absorbed into any existing section. New sections must match surrounding sections in granularity and style.

**3. Write behavior language, not patch language.**
Each inserted sentence states what the system promises to callers, not that something was added. Avoid connective words like "also supports", "additionally", "in addition to". State the behavior directly as if it was always there.
